## üîß Solutions

### Option 1: Increase Quota (Recommended)
1. Go to IBM Cloud Console: https://cloud.ibm.com/registry/quota
2. Increase storage quota for account
3. Wait for quota reset (usually monthly)
4. Re-run migration script

### Option 2: Clean Up Old Images
```bash
# List all images in Brazil registry
ibmcloud cr region-set br.icr.io
ibmcloud cr images --restrict br-ibm-images

# Delete unused images
ibmcloud cr image-rm br.icr.io/br-ibm-images/<image-name>:<tag>
```

### Option 3: Use Different Target Registry
- Use AWS ECR instead of IBM Container Registry
- Use JFrog Artifactory with different backend
- Use local Harbor registry

### Option 4: Migrate to Different Account
- Use different IBM Cloud account with available quota
- Transfer images incrementally
